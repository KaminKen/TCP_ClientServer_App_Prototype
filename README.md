# TCP_ClientServer_App_Prototype
A TCP client–server prototype built in C# using .NET sockets. The project demonstrates low-level TCP/IP communication, custom message struct design, connection handling, and real-time data exchange between distributed processes. The goal is to bridge networking theory with practical, industry-level socket implementation and architecture design.
